######## 1GeV Muon ########
Energy at x = -0.1: E = 1.00557 GeV
Energy at x = +0.1: E = 1.00356 GeV

ΔE = 2.01 MeV

ΔE/Δx = 2.01 MeV/20cm = 0.1005 MeV/cm

1/ρ * ΔE/Δx = 1/(8.96 g/cm^3) * 0.1005 MeV/cm = 0.0112 MeV cm^2/g


A muon with an energy of 1 GeV should be round about the minimum ionization energy following the Bethe Bloch Formula which would amount to roughly 1/ρ * ΔE/Δx = 1 MeV*cm^2/g
My simualtion in Geant4 is a couple of orders of magnitude off :(

I used hPrimaryEnergy->Print("all") to the get the most precise values for the energies and tried the 1 GeV simulation a couple of times but i always get such low energy differences


######## 1 GeV Pion #######

Energy at x = -0.1: E = 1.00969 GeV
Energy at x = +0.1: E = 1.00748 GeV

ΔE = 2.21 MeV

ΔE/Δx = 2.01 MeV/20cm = 0.1105 MeV/cm

1/ρ * ΔE/Δx = 1/(8.96 g/cm^3) * 0.1005 MeV/cm = 0.0123 MeV cm^2/g


Similarly to the muon the simulated energy loss is a couple of orders of magnitude off from the expected energy loss of ~ 1.3 MeV*cm^2/g

It could very well be that i am somehow missing a factor 10^3 somewhere for the muon as well as the pion but I don't know where. 
It is quite strange that both have the same error. Maybe in the Geant4 simulation there is an error where a 10^3 factor is somewhere unaccounted for?
