Muons with lower energies are more prone of being deflected via their interactions with the copper block. 
The higher the energy of a muon the less it interacts and for the highest energies such as 100 GeV or 1000 GeV the muon flight path is almost straight.
Very low energetic muons with only 0.3 GeV are most often completely absorved by the material and their flight path is completely bent.
The most predominant interacts seen in the pictures, I assume, are some sort of ionization and Coulomb scattering
